<!-- If else and else if statements. see video around 45min. -->

This is how to inject a true false into the html using python- it renders if and only if the variable boolean (in auth) is true- if it is false then the statement will not render to the site. Can use the if else also. This is the jinga formatting that doesnt look great but it works. -->
{% if boolean == True %} Yes Its True! {% endif %}
